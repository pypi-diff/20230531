 Every Oqtant job input can hold notes up to 500 characters long. These notes can be used to add context and additional information to each input. Notes remain tied to their inputs and can be referenced later. To add a note to a job input simply provide a string value to your desired input object like below:

 # so we will add the note to the first and only input in the array

 ## View your current job limits
 
 Your account provides you with a limited number of jobs which you can run in a given period of time. You can check your limits and current status against those limits via the `oqtant_client.get_limits()` method:
 
+
 ```python
 limits = oqtant_client.get_job_limits()
 print(limits)
 ```
 
 If you are running batch jobs, each run is counted as a job against your limit (i.e., a batch job with 10 runs counts as 10 against your limits).

These primitives include *rf_evaporation*, *optical_barriers*, *optical_landscape*, and *lasers*.  Much like an *OqtantJob* itself, these constituent primitives are programmatic objects in their own right and can be instantiated and manipulated outside of a job object.  Although not shown explicitly in our simple job data structure above, both *optical_barriers* and *lasers* are lists containing *Barrier* and *Laser* objects, respectively.  These objects will be explored below.  You are likely already familiar with the structure of the *rf_evaporation* data and how defining that data controls the evaporation to BEC in the experiment.  The *optical_landscape* data is a bit more complicated and will be explored in more detail below in a dedicated section.       
 
-Not all job types support every one of these data structures. For the basic BEC-type job above, we did not have data entries for barriers, the landscape, or lasers. BEC jobs, for instance, only support the rf*evaporation primitive. After all, the purpose of a BEC job is to keep things simple and just focus on the ability to tune the creation of the condensate. At the next level of complexity, BARRIER jobs support both \_rf_evaporation* and _optical_barriers_ but not "optical_landscape" or "lasers". What data structures are supported by different job types will become clear as those job types are created/used/submitted. As a preview, please refer to the following table.

 ## The RfEvaporation Object
 
-Every job input has exactly one constituent RfEvaporation object defined by the "rf_evaporation" data shown above. The behavior of this object controls the RF knife evaporation from an ultracold gas to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), as well as providing flexibility for applying RF fields during the experiment phase after the initial evaporation is complete. The evaporation stage results in a tradeoff between final atom number and temperature -- evaporating more deeply, signified by RF detuning values closer to 0, produces less atoms but at colder temperature (and correspondingly higher condensate fraction). Applying RF radiation during the experiment phase allows for hot atoms above some temperature, produced for example by rapid manipulation of optical barries or landscape potentials (explored below), to be removed the experiment -- a so-called "RF shield".

-It is important to note here that we adopt the convention that time = 0 refers to the _end_ of the evaporation period. As such, the initial evaporation to BEC, as defined by the object under current inspection, will involve negative (relative) times. In our trap, the entire evaporation cycle takes on the order of a second, and times are specified in ms, so we should see negative times as large as a few thousand ms.

 ### Construction

         interpolation = "LINEAR"
 )
 ```
 
 or by placing the underlying data in a dictionary and unpacking that dictionary in order to pass it to the constructor:
 
+
 ```python
 evap = JobSchema.RfEvaporation(**{
         "times_ms": [-1600, -1200, -800, -400, 0],

         "interpolation": "LINEAR"
 })
 ```
 
-Inherent to the RfEvaporation object are three lists, _times_ms_, _frequencies_mhz_, and _powers_mw_. The key prefix corresponds to the parameter being controlled, while the suffix refers to the associated units. In this case, we specify a list of times in milliseconds (ms), frequencies in MHz (mhz), and powers in milliwatts (mw). Note that all units are lower case, which can cause confusion if taken out of context. All three lists must share the same length as each time element is paired with the corresponding element of the frequencies/powers list(s). The specified behavior of the RF evaporation stage defind by the above data is as follows: At -1.6 seconds the RF power is set at 500 mW and the frequency (detuning) at 17 MHz. By the end of the evaporation period, defined by t=0, the frequency/detuning has decreased to 0.045 MHz = 45 kHz and the power has been reduced to 220 mW. Intermediate values of frequency and power are adopted between those two points in time, with the full time dependence being a result of the given data and chosen interpolation type, which controls how the RF fields behave between the given data points.

-Frequencies are given as a detuning with respect to the energetic trap bottom, so RF fields at a frequency/detuning of 0 would eliminate all atoms from the trap. Achieving final BEC temperatures on the order of 100 nK usually corresponds to final RF frequencies of a few tens of kHz. Powers refer to the amount of power delivered to an antenna that bathes the ultracold atoms with RF radiation. The actual local RF field experienced by the atoms depends on system losses and the exact geometry of the antenna.

 ### Time-dependent evaporation parameters
 
-We can explore the time-dependence of the RFEvaporation object frequency and power, as defined by the data structure above, using some useful functions included with oqtant. For example, we can query the object for the instantaneous power or frequency at any point in time. Recall that the units of power are mW and the units of frequency are MHz.

 print(evap.get_frequency(time = -1800))     # request before first defined object time of -1600 ms -> 0.0
 ```
 
-This behavior is generic to most objects in oqtant -- any temporal or spatial extrapolation requests yield 0.0.

 ## Barrier Objects

+
 ### Construction
 
-First, let us demonstrate the construction of a Barrier object, which represents a one-dimensional optical potential barrier to the BEC. A barrier is characterized by a shape, a time-dependent position, height, and width, and information on how to interpolate over the underlying data in time. For example, let us construct a Barrier object named _barr_ for which the center scans from 1-11 microns in the first 10 ms of an experiment. Over this same time period, the barrier height will increase from 1 kHz to 11 kHz. The width will remain constant at 1 micron throughout, as will the (fixed) Gaussian shape. In this case, the width parameter corresponds to the Gaussian width of the barrier.

 $$
 U(x) = H e^{-\frac{(x - x_0)^2}{2 w^2}} \quad \textrm{(GAUSSIAN)}
 $$
-
-where $H=H(t)$, $x_{0} = x_{0}(t)$, and $w = w(t)$ represent the time-dependent barrier height, center position, and width, respectively. In this case, our width parameter corresponds to the traditional definition of the Gaussian width, often denoted as $\sigma$.

 For the LORENTZIAN case, the potential follows
-
 $$

-

 ### Exploring Barrier interpolation options
 
-A Barrier object's 'interpolation' style determines how the time-dependent position, height, and width are determined for intermediate times between the provided data points in the 'times*ms' list class member. At this time, the interpolation choice is \_shared* for all three time-dependent barrier parameters. Let us explore the effects of different interpolation choices by altering the time-dependent position of our barrier, to make it a little more interesting, and then plot the position over time for a few different interpolation choices.

Other interpolation options, like 'SMOOTH' (which is functionally equivalent to 'CUBIC'), give rise to a continually varying barrier position (and height/width). The full list of interpolation options is as follows:

 ## The Optical Landscape Object
 
-Another Oqtant job primitive is the (singular) 'OpticalLandscape' object. This construct is similar to the optical barriers list in the sense that it instructs the experiment to apply 1D optical potentials, in the form of painted blue-detuned light, to the condensate over the course of the experiment. However, now the user (you!) is free to specify a list of positions and corresponding potential energies at specified times, instead of being limited to the concept of a singular barrier or combination of multiple barriers.

 ### Understanding the time dependence of the composed OpticalLandscape object
 
-The time-dependence of the overall optical potential-energy landscape, as derived from the individual _landscapes[]_ list, is somewhat complicated. As for _Barrier_ and other similar objects, any temporal extrapolation (behavior for data outside the defined time period, i.e. before the first or after the last elements of the _landscapes[]_ list) results in zero potential (in the absence of any other sources, such as Barriers). Therefore, the only way to get a non-zero painted potential optical landscape is to define at least two landscapes that can be interpolated between. To hold a static (unchanging) potential during a period of the experiment, one would define two elements of the _landscapes[]_ list with identical potential energy profiles but differing times, with the potential being applied between those two times. If one desires the potential to change dynamically, then adjacent elements of the _landscapes[]_ list (elements with the nearest _time_ms_ values) should define the snapshots of the desired potential at the temporal endpoints. In between these endpoints the potential landscape is interpolated point-by-point (in position) according to the user-specified value for _interpolation_. This process continues so that, at the specified times of the elements of _landscapes[]_, the overall optical potential energy landscape instantaneously equal to those individual landscapes.

In between these endpoints the potential landscape is interpolated point-by-point (in position) according to the user-specified value for *interpolation*.  This process continues so that, at the specified times of the elements of *landscapes[]*, the overall optical potential energy landscape instantaneously equal to those individual landscapes.  
+
+In our example above, with linear interpolation, this means that there will be a period of no optical potential between 0 and 1 ms, our *landscape_1* potential will start being applied at 1 ms, this potential will smoothly (linearly, in this case) morph into the *landscape_2* potential between 1 and 10 ms, and then this potential landscape will be held until the end of the experiment.  Let us use oqtant's visualization functions to inspect this behavior to make it clear.

 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 0.9)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 1)

 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 5)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 7)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 9)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 11)
 ```
 
-As descibed above, we can see zero overall potential both before the first and after the last times of the individual Landscape objects. At 1 ms, the first Landscape is assumed. The potential landscape then morphs into our second Landscape object at t = 10 ms.

 ### Construction
 
-Let us begin by constructing a _Laser_ object, which gives the user control over near-resonant laser light applied to the atoms over the course of the experiment. This differs from the painted potential laser, which is far off-resonance in order to apply potential energy landscapes and barriers to the trapped condensate. Resonant or near-resonant light, on the other hand, results in scattering of photons from the light field by the atoms. This is useful, for example, in TRANSISTOR jobs where we want to remove atoms from some spatial region of the trap using a so-called TERMINATOR laser.
